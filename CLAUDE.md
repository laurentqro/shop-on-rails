# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Rails 8 e-commerce application for selling eco-friendly catering supplies. The application uses Vite for frontend asset bundling with TailwindCSS 4 and DaisyUI for styling, Hotwire (Turbo + Stimulus) for interactivity, Stripe for payments, and PostgreSQL as the database.

## Development Commands

### Initial Setup
```bash
bin/setup               # Install dependencies, setup database, and start server
bin/setup --skip-server # Setup without starting the server
```

### Running the Application
```bash
bin/dev                 # Start Rails server and Vite dev server (uses foreman)
rails server            # Run Rails server only (port 3000)
bin/vite dev            # Run Vite dev server only
```

### Database Commands
```bash
rails db:migrate        # Run pending migrations
rails db:seed           # Seed the database
rails db:prepare        # Create database if needed and run migrations
rails db:reset          # Drop, create, migrate, and seed database
```

### Testing
```bash
rails test              # Run all tests
rails test:system       # Run system tests (uses Capybara + Selenium)
rails test test/models/product_test.rb              # Run a specific test file
rails test test/models/product_test.rb:10           # Run specific test by line number
```

### Code Quality
```bash
rubocop                 # Run RuboCop linter (uses rails-omakase config)
brakeman                # Run security vulnerability scanner
```

### Asset Management
Vite automatically compiles assets during development. For production builds:
```bash
bin/vite build          # Build assets for production
```

### Rails Console
```bash
rails console           # Open Rails console
rails c                 # Shorthand
```

## Architecture Overview

### Frontend Architecture (Vite + Rails)

**Asset Pipeline**: Uses Vite Rails instead of traditional Sprockets/Propshaft
- Entry points: `app/frontend/entrypoints/application.js` and `application.css`
- Assets organized in `app/frontend/` directory (images, fonts, stylesheets, javascript)
- Vite config: `vite.config.mts` with TailwindCSS 4 plugin and Rails integration
- Auto-reload on changes to routes and views

**JavaScript Stack**:
- Hotwire Turbo for SPA-like navigation
- Stimulus controllers for interactive components (`app/frontend/javascript/controllers/`)
  - `carousel_controller.js` - Swiper.js carousel integration
  - `cart_drawer_controller.js` - Shopping cart drawer functionality
- Swiper for carousels
- Active Storage for file uploads

**Styling**:
- TailwindCSS 4 for utility-first styling
- DaisyUI component library for pre-built UI components
- Custom styles in `app/frontend/stylesheets/`

### Backend Architecture

**Models**:
- `Product` - Has variants, belongs to category, uses slugs for URLs
  - Default scope filters active products and orders by sort_order
  - `ProductVariant` - Price and inventory tracking (SKU, stock, price)
- `Category` - Organizes products
- `Cart` / `CartItem` - Shopping cart (supports both guest and user carts)
  - VAT calculation at 20% (UK)
  - Cart can belong to user or be guest cart
- `Order` / `OrderItem` - Completed purchases
  - Stores Stripe session ID
  - Captures shipping details from Stripe Checkout
- `User` / `Session` - Authentication (Rails 8 built-in authentication with bcrypt)
- `Current` - ActiveSupport::CurrentAttributes for request-scoped state (user, session, cart)

**Controllers**:
- `PagesController` - Static pages (home, shop, about, contact, terms, privacy, cookies)
- `ProductsController` - Product listing and detail pages
- `CategoriesController` - Category pages
- `CartsController` / `CartItemsController` - Shopping cart management
- `CheckoutsController` - Stripe Checkout integration
  - Creates Stripe sessions with line items, shipping, and tax
  - Handles success callback to create orders
  - Uses `Current.cart` for cart state
- `OrdersController` - Order history and details
- `Admin::ProductsController` - Admin product management
- `Admin::OrdersController` - Admin order management
- `FeedsController` - Google Merchant feed generation

**Key Patterns**:
- Uses slugs for SEO-friendly URLs (`Product#to_param` returns slug)
- Products have variants for different sizes/options
- Authentication uses Rails 8 built-in patterns with `allow_unauthenticated_access` macro
- Guest carts tracked by cookie, merged on user login
- VAT calculated on checkout (20% UK rate)
- Stripe Checkout for payment processing with shipping address collection

### Database Configuration

**Multi-database setup** for production (Solid Queue, Solid Cache, Solid Cable):
- Primary: Main application data (PostgreSQL)
- Cache: Solid Cache database
- Queue: Solid Queue for background jobs
- Cable: Solid Cable for Action Cable

Development uses single PostgreSQL database: `shop_development`

### Payment Flow (Stripe)

1. User clicks checkout â†’ `CheckoutsController#create`
2. Creates Stripe Checkout Session with:
   - Line items from cart
   - UK VAT (20%) as tax rate
   - Shipping address collection (GB only)
   - Standard and Express shipping options
3. User completes payment on Stripe
4. Stripe redirects to `CheckoutsController#success` with session_id
5. Retrieves Stripe session, creates Order and OrderItems
6. Clears cart and sends confirmation email
7. Prevents duplicate orders by checking `stripe_session_id`

### Email Configuration

- Uses Mailgun gem for transactional emails
- Order confirmation emails sent via `OrderMailer`
- Registration emails for email verification
- Password reset functionality

### Third-Party Services

**Required credentials** (stored in Rails encrypted credentials):
- Stripe API keys (test and live)
- Mailgun API credentials
- AWS S3 credentials (for Active Storage in production)

Edit credentials:
```bash
rails credentials:edit
```

## Important File Locations

- Routes: `config/routes.rb`
- Database schema: `db/schema.rb`
- Vite entrypoints: `app/frontend/entrypoints/`
- Stimulus controllers: `app/frontend/javascript/controllers/`
- View components: `app/views/`
- Credentials: `config/credentials.yml.enc` (use `rails credentials:edit`)

## Development Tips

### Working with Products
- Products require a category and generate slugs automatically from name/SKU/colour
- Always work with `product.active_variants` not `product.variants` (filters inactive)
- Use `product.default_variant` for single variant products
- Price range calculated from all active variants

### Working with Cart
- Use `Current.cart` to access current user's cart
- Cart automatically handles guest vs authenticated users
- VAT calculated at `Cart::VAT_RATE` (0.2)
- Cart methods: `items_count`, `subtotal_amount`, `vat_amount`, `total_amount`

### Authentication
- Uses Rails 8 authentication with Session model
- Allow public access with `allow_unauthenticated_access` in controllers
- Current user available via `Current.user`
- Session stored in encrypted cookie

### Admin Area
- Namespaced under `/admin`
- Manage products and variants
- View and manage orders
- Add authentication checks before deploying to production

### Testing Payments Locally
Use Stripe test mode card numbers:
- Success: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
- Requires authentication: `4000 0025 0000 3155`
- Declined: `4000 0000 0000 9995`

### Google Merchant Feed
- Available at `/feeds/google-merchant.xml`
- Auto-generates product feed for Google Shopping
- Includes product data, pricing, images, and availability
