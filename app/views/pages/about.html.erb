  <p class="mb-4">
    It all started in the aftermath of lockdown, when Marco Bungish had one simple but powerful idea: there had to be a better alternative to those soggy, short-lived paper straws. After rounds of testing and debates, Marco stumbled upon a game-changing solution — a straw made from bamboo pulp. Stronger, longer-lasting, and 100% eco-friendly, it was everything the paper straw wasn't.

    Excited by the discovery, Marco teamed up with his lifelong friend Tariq, and together they launched B&B Eco — from the most humble of HQs: Tariq's living room.

    Armed with passion and a box full of bamboo straws, they hit the ground running — sending samples to bars, restaurants, and hotels across the UK. The response? Overwhelming. Customers loved the fact that these straws didn't turn to mush mid-mojito and could actually last the duration of a drink (or two).

    Fast forward four years, and B&B Eco has grown into Afida — now proudly supplying a wide range of sustainable packaging to hundreds of businesses, from independent cafés to global names like The PGA Tour, Marriott Bonvoy Group, Silverstone, Hawksmoor, The Grove, The Ritz, Cook Daily, and the Royal Automobile Club.
