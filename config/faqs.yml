    questions:
      - id: types-of-products
        question: "What types of packaging products do you offer?"
        answer: "We supply a wide range of packaging solutions including unbranded (plain) stock items and fully branded products with custom printing and artwork. Whether you need simple stock boxes or packaging that carries your logo and brand identity, we've got you covered."
      - id: unbranded-meaning
        question: "What does \"unbranded\" mean?"
        answer: "\"Unbranded\" refers to products that come without any custom printing, logo or design — simply ready for use as-is or for you to brand yourself later. These are a cost‑effective option when you don't need custom printing."
      - id: branded-meaning
        question: "What does \"branded\" mean?"
        answer: "\"Branded\" products are customised with your company's logo, colours, design and artwork. We handle the printing or finishing so your packaging aligns with your brand identity and looks professional."
      - id: materials
        question: "What materials do you use for your packaging?"
        answer: "We offer packaging in a variety of materials depending on the product application — for example kraft board, food‑safe card, corrugated board, tubes and cylinders, and sustainable materials where appropriate. (Materials selection may vary by product.)"

  - id: custom-printing
    title: "Custom Printing & Branding"
    questions:
      - id: moq
        question: "What is the minimum order quantity (MOQ) for branded items?"
        answer: "For branded products, a minimum order quantity (MOQ) typically applies. This allows the cost of tooling, printing setup and finishing to be spread across the batch. If you are unsure, please contact us with the specific product and size you are interested in for the MOQ details."
      - id: own-artwork
        question: "Can I use my own artwork and logo?"
        answer: "Yes — we welcome your artwork and logo files. We'll provide specifications for print‑ready files (format, colour mode, bleed, resolution etc.). Our team can also help review your files and advise if any changes are needed for print quality."
      - id: branding-time
        question: "How long does branding take?"
        answer: "The lead time for branded items depends on several factors: quantity, material, print method, current workload and shipping. Once artwork is approved and order confirmed, we'll provide a clear timeline. For stock unbranded items the dispatch is typically faster."
      - id: artwork-changes
        question: "What if I change my mind about the artwork after approval?"
        answer: "Changes to artwork after approval may incur additional cost or delay. We recommend reviewing proofs carefully before approving to avoid unexpected costs or time lags."

      - id: delivery-cost-time
        question: "How much does delivery cost and how long will it take?"

      - id: international-shipping
        question: "Can you ship internationally?"
        answer: "Yes — we can ship to anywhere. For international orders, higher delivery costs, customs duties, taxes and longer transit times may apply."
      - id: small-quantity
        question: "What if I only need a small quantity?"
        answer: "If you require small quantities, unbranded stock products are usually a better fit because they are kept as inventory and can be shipped quickly. Branded products may have higher minimums due to setup costs."

  - id: returns-quality
    title: "Returns, Refunds & Quality"
    questions:
      - id: returns-policy
        question: "What is your returns policy?"
        answer: "For unbranded stock items, you may cancel or return within 14 days subject to them being unused and in resalable condition. For branded items (customised), returns are generally not accepted unless there is a manufacturing defect, because they cannot be resold. Please check each product's terms before ordering."
      - id: faulty-branding
        question: "What if the branding is incorrect or printing is faulty?"
        answer: "In the unlikely event of a printing or manufacturing defect, please contact us immediately with photos and details. We will assess the issue and offer a rectification: replacement, credit or refund, depending on the situation."
      - id: food-safe
        question: "Are your products food‑safe / compliant with regulations?"
        answer: "Yes — for packaging intended for food contact, we ensure that materials and manufacturing comply with relevant UK/EU regulations. If you have specific regulatory requirements (e.g., for export or special use), please advise before placing your order."

      - id: disposal
        question: "How should I dispose of the packaging?"

      - id: stocking-cost
        question: "Is the cost of stocking included in the price?"
        answer: "In many cases, yes — stocking can be included within the unit price or added as a transparent cost, depending on the agreement. This helps spread the cost over time and simplifies your logistics."
      - id: no-stocking
        question: "What if I don't want you to stock the products?"
        answer: "No problem. During the quoting or checkout process, simply deselect the stocking option. Our pricing tool will automatically update to reflect the cost without storage."
      - id: stocking-delivery-costs
        question: "Does stocking affect delivery costs?"
        answer: "Stocking can help reduce your delivery frequency and cost, since we consolidate shipments based on your schedule. However, if you prefer to handle logistics independently, you're welcome to collect stock or arrange your own shipping."
      - id: part-delivery
