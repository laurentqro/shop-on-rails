## 1. Multi-Channel Platform Strategy

### Priority 1: Google Ads (Shopping + Search)

**Why**: Captures high-intent traffic from businesses actively searching for catering supplies

**Target ROAS**: 4:1 ($4 revenue per $1 spent)

**Strategy Components**:

1. **Google Shopping Ads** (Primary)
   - Product discovery for users browsing catering supplies
   - Visual product showcase with pricing
   - Accounts for ~65% of all Google Ads clicks for retailers
   - Lower funnel, high purchase intent

2. **Search Ads** (Complementary)
   - Branded keywords: "Afida", "Afida catering supplies"
   - High-intent keywords:
     - "eco-friendly catering supplies"
     - "sustainable disposable plates UK"
     - "compostable coffee cups wholesale"
     - "biodegradable cutlery bulk"
   - Competitor keywords (carefully targeted)

3. **Bidding Strategy**:
   - Start with "Maximize Conversions" bidding
   - Do NOT set target ROAS/CPA initially
   - After 30-50 conversions, add target ROAS
   - Create custom column for gross profit after ad spend
   - Optimize for profit, not just revenue

4. **Performance Max Campaigns** (After testing)
   - Let Google AI optimize across all channels
   - Requires quality assets (images, videos, headlines)
   - Can reduce CPA and increase ROAS with proper setup

### Priority 2: Meta Ads (Facebook + Instagram)

**Why**: Build brand awareness and retarget warm audiences (Meta delivers 52% higher ROI than average channels for e-commerce)

**Target ROAS**: 4:1 benchmark

**Strategy Components**:

1. **Advantage+ Shopping Campaigns**
   - AI-powered optimization (reduces CPA by 17%, increases ROAS by 32%)
   - Automated creative, targeting, and placements
   - Let Meta's algorithm find best audiences
   - Budget to hit ~50 optimization events during learning phase

2. **Carousel Ads**
   - Showcase multiple products in swipeable format
   - 10-30% higher CTR than single image ads
   - Perfect for showing product range (cups → plates → cutlery)
   - Include sustainability message on first card

3. **Collection Ads**
   - Combine hero image/video with product catalog
   - Enable instant shopping experience
   - Great for mobile users (majority of Meta traffic)

4. **Retargeting Campaigns**
   - Dynamic Product Ads showing viewed products
   - 70% higher conversion rate than standard ads
   - Focus on high-value products and warm audiences

### Budget Allocation

**Recommended Split**:
- 60% Google Ads (higher intent, better ROAS typically)
- 40% Meta Ads (awareness + retargeting)

**Adjust based on performance**:
- Monitor ROAS by channel weekly
- Scale winning platforms by 10-20% increments
- Maintain minimum ad spend for algorithm learning

## 2. Google Shopping Feed Optimization

### Current Status

✅ **Good news**: You already have `/feeds/google-merchant.xml` set up!

### Critical Optimizations Needed

#### Product Titles (Max 150 characters)

**Current Format** (likely):
```
"Product Name"
```

**Optimized Format**:
```
[Brand] [Product Type] [Size] [Material] [Eco Feature] - [Pack Size]
```

**Examples**:
- ✅ "Afida Compostable Coffee Cups 12oz Paper PLA-Lined - 50 Pack"
- ✅ "Afida Biodegradable Plates 9in Sugarcane FSC Certified - 25 Pack"
- ✅ "Afida Wooden Cutlery Set Birchwood Compostable - 100 Piece Bulk"

**Best Practices**:
- Put high-intent keywords first (brand, product type, key attributes)
- Include size/volume (12oz, 9in, etc.)
- Add material (paper, sugarcane, birchwood)
- Highlight eco credentials (compostable, FSC certified)
- Add pack size for B2B buyers
- Stay under 150 characters to avoid truncation
- Use natural language (not keyword stuffing)

#### Product Descriptions (First 160 chars critical)

**First 160 characters appear in ads** - make them count!

**Optimized Format**:
```
[Brand] [Product Type] are perfect for [Use Case]. Made from [Material]
with [Features], fully [Eco Credential]. [Certification].
```

**Example**:
```
Afida 12oz compostable coffee cups are perfect for eco-conscious cafes and
catering businesses. Made from sustainably sourced paper with PLA lining,
fully compostable in commercial facilities. EN 13432 certified.

Premium quality that your customers will notice - sturdy construction,
leak-resistant, and heat-safe. Available in bulk packs for business use
with competitive wholesale pricing. Free UK shipping on orders over £50.
```

**Include**:
- Product benefits (not just features)
- Use cases (cafes, caterers, events)
- Sustainability credentials
- Certifications (EN 13432, FSC)
- Business benefits (bulk pricing, shipping)

#### Custom Labels (For Bid Optimization)

Add these to your product feed:

```xml
<g:custom_label_0>high_margin</g:custom_label_0>  <!-- Profit margin: high/medium/low -->
<g:custom_label_1>best_seller</g:custom_label_1>  <!-- Best seller: yes/no -->
<g:custom_label_2>year_round</g:custom_label_2>   <!-- Seasonal: year_round/seasonal -->
<g:custom_label_3>cups</g:custom_label_3>         <!-- Category: cups/plates/cutlery/etc -->
<g:custom_label_4>b2b_priority</g:custom_label_4> <!-- Priority: high/medium/low -->
```

**Usage**:
- Create separate campaigns for high vs. low margin products
- Bid higher on best sellers
- Adjust budgets seasonally
- Test category-specific strategies

#### Product Identifiers

**Critical for visibility**:
- **GTIN** (Global Trade Item Number) - can increase clicks by 20%
- **MPN** (Manufacturer Part Number) - required if no GTIN
- **Brand** - always required ("Afida")

**Missing identifiers = limited reach and product errors**

#### Image Quality

**Requirements**:
- Minimum 800x800px (recommended: 1200x1200px)
- White or transparent background preferred
- Show product clearly (not lifestyle/in-use shots for main image)
- High quality, well-lit, in-focus
- No watermarks or promotional text

**Tips**:
- Use `:product_photo` for main image (close-up)
- Use `:lifestyle_photo` for additional images
- Show product from multiple angles if possible

#### Feed Maintenance

**Update Frequency**:
- Daily updates recommended (prices, stock, new products)
- Minimum: every 30 minutes (Google's limit)
- Critical for fast-moving inventory

**What to Update**:
- Prices (ensure accuracy)
- Availability (in stock / out of stock)
- New products (add immediately)
- Seasonal promotions
- Stock quantities (optional but helpful)

#### 2025 Platform Updates to Leverage

**Performance Max 2.0**:

## 3. Retargeting Strategy (Cart Abandonment)

### The Problem

**Average cart abandonment rate**: 60-70%

This means 60-70 out of every 100 shoppers who add items to cart leave without purchasing. That's a massive opportunity for recovery.

### The Opportunity

**Retargeting performance**:
- Retargeting ads are 76% more likely to be clicked than regular display ads

- Run on both Google Display Network and Meta platforms

```

## 7. Tracking & Measurement Setup

### Essential Tracking Implementation

#### Google Analytics 4 (GA4)

**E-commerce Events** (Critical):
```javascript
// View item
gtag('event', 'view_item', {
  currency: 'GBP',
  value: 15.99,
  items: [...]
});

// Add to cart
gtag('event', 'add_to_cart', {
  currency: 'GBP',
  value: 15.99,
  items: [...]
});

// Begin checkout
gtag('event', 'begin_checkout', {
  currency: 'GBP',
  value: 47.97,
  items: [...]
});

// Purchase
gtag('event', 'purchase', {
  transaction_id: 'T12345',
  value: 47.97,
  currency: 'GBP',
  items: [...]
});
```

**Custom Events**:
```javascript
// Request quote (high-intent)
gtag('event', 'request_quote', {
  value: estimated_order_value,
  items: [...]
});

// Product finder usage
gtag('event', 'product_finder_used', {
  search_term: 'compostable cups'
});

// Certification badge click
gtag('event', 'certification_click', {
  badge_type: 'EN 13432'
});
```

#### Google Ads Conversion Tracking

**Primary Conversions** (Drive bidding):
```
1. Purchase (transaction_id, value, items)
2. Lead form submission
3. Phone call (call tracking)
```

**Secondary Conversions** (Monitor, don't bid on):
```
1. Add to cart
2. Begin checkout
3. Email signup
4. Catalog download
5. Request quote
```

**Enhanced Conversions**:
- Enable for better attribution
- Hash customer email/phone for privacy
- Improves conversion tracking accuracy by 5-15%

#### Meta Pixel

**Standard Events**:
```javascript
// PageView (automatic)
fbq('track', 'PageView');

// ViewContent
fbq('track', 'ViewContent', {
  content_ids: ['12345'],
  content_type: 'product',
  value: 15.99,
  currency: 'GBP'
});

// AddToCart
fbq('track', 'AddToCart', {
  content_ids: ['12345'],
  content_type: 'product',
  value: 15.99,
  currency: 'GBP'
});

// InitiateCheckout
fbq('track', 'InitiateCheckout', {
  value: 47.97,
  currency: 'GBP',
  num_items: 3
});

// Purchase
fbq('track', 'Purchase', {
  value: 47.97,
  currency: 'GBP',
  transaction_id: 'T12345'
});
```

**Conversions API** (Server-side):
- Implement for iOS 14.5+ tracking
- Bypass browser tracking limitations
- Improves attribution by 10-20%

### Key Metrics to Monitor

#### Campaign Performance Metrics

**ROAS (Return on Ad Spend)**:
```
Target: 4:1 minimum (£4 revenue per £1 ad spend)
Formula: Revenue ÷ Ad Spend
- Excellent: 5:1+
- Good: 4:1 - 5:1

## Conclusion

This comprehensive advertising strategy provides Afida with a roadmap to drive high-converting traffic and build a profitable, scalable acquisition engine.

### Key Takeaways

1. **Multi-channel approach**: Leverage both Google (high intent) and Meta (awareness + retargeting)
2. **Quick wins first**: Optimize Google Merchant feed, launch cart abandonment emails, set up tracking

7. **Measure everything**: Track ROAS, CPA, CLV, cart abandonment, and optimize accordingly

### Next Steps

1. **Week 1**: Implement Quick Wins (tracking, free shipping, cart emails)
2. **Week 2**: Optimize product feed and launch Google Shopping
3. **Week 3**: Launch Meta retargeting and begin testing
4. **Month 2+**: Scale winning campaigns and expand strategies
